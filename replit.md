# Shoot'ha – replit.md

## Overview

Shoot'ha (شوتها) is a mobile-first sports venue booking application built for the Saudi/Arabic market. It allows players to discover, book, and manage football field reservations, and lets venue owners manage their sports facilities. The app is a React Native / Expo application with an Express.js backend server, targeting iOS, Android, and web platforms.

Key features include:
- Role-based access (Player, Owner, Guest)
- OTP-based phone number authentication (no password)
- Venue discovery and booking with time slot selection
- Booking management with player payment tracking
- 1-Click rebook system for repeating past bookings
- Animated splash screen with football animation
- Full RTL (right-to-left) Arabic UI
- Dark mode only interface with neon green accent

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (React Native / Expo)

**Framework:** Expo SDK 54 with Expo Router v6 (file-based routing)

The app uses file-based routing under the `app/` directory:
- `app/_layout.tsx` – Root layout with providers and animated splash overlay
- `app/(tabs)/` – Main tab navigation (Home, Search, Bookings, Profile)
- `app/venue/[id].tsx` – Venue detail and booking screen
- `app/booking/[id].tsx` – Booking detail management
- `app/select-role.tsx` – Role selection (Player / Owner / Guest)
- `app/auth/player/` – Player authentication flow (login, register, verify-otp)
- `app/auth/owner/` – Owner authentication flow (login, register, verify-otp)

**Navigation:** Expo Router with tab-based navigation. On iOS with Liquid Glass support it uses `NativeTabs` from `expo-router/unstable-native-tabs`; on other platforms it falls back to a standard `Tabs` component with a BlurView tab bar.

**State Management:**
- `context/AuthContext.tsx` – Authentication state (user, token, guest mode), persisted via AsyncStorage
- `context/BookingsContext.tsx` – Bookings and venues state, persisted via AsyncStorage
- TanStack React Query for server data fetching

**UI Design:**
- Dark theme only (`#0A0A0A` background, `#2ECC71` neon green accent)
- All colors centralized in `constants/colors.ts`
- Cairo Arabic font family (Regular, SemiBold, Bold) via `@expo-google-fonts/cairo`
- Animated shimmer skeleton loading via `components/SkeletonCard.tsx` (replaces spinners)
- Haptic feedback on interactions
- RTL Arabic text throughout

**Key Components:**
- `AuthInput` – Animated input with glow effect and error state
- `VenueCard` – Venue listing card with gradient overlay and badge indicators
- `SkeletonCard` / `SkeletonVenueCard` – Animated shimmer placeholders
- `GuestModal` – Bottom sheet prompting guests to log in
- `ErrorBoundary` / `ErrorFallback` – App-level error catching with restart option
- `KeyboardAwareScrollViewCompat` – Cross-platform keyboard-aware scroll (uses `react-native-keyboard-controller` on native, plain `ScrollView` on web)

### Backend (Express.js)

**Framework:** Express.js v5 running as a standalone Node.js server

**Entry point:** `server/index.ts` – Sets up CORS (allowing Replit dev domains and localhost), JSON parsing, and static file serving

**Routes** (`server/routes.ts`):
- `POST /api/auth/send-otp` – Generates and stores a 6-digit OTP for a phone number; returns OTP in dev mode
- `POST /api/auth/register` – Creates new user with phone + name + role + OTP verification
- `POST /api/auth/login` – Verifies OTP and returns JWT
- `GET /api/auth/me` – Returns authenticated user info (JWT protected)
- Additional booking/venue routes implied by the architecture

**Authentication:**
- Phone number + OTP (no passwords for end users)
- JWT tokens signed with `SESSION_SECRET` env var, 30-day expiry
- `authMiddleware` function validates Bearer tokens on protected routes

**Storage (`server/storage.ts`):**
- Currently uses `MemStorage` (in-memory Maps) as the active storage implementation
- `IStorage` interface is defined, making it easy to swap to a database-backed implementation
- OTPs expire after a set duration and are stored in memory

**Build system:** `scripts/build.js` handles the Expo static web build + server bundling for deployment on Replit

### Database

**Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`) uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect:
- `users` table – Basic username/password users (legacy or admin)
- `auth_users` table – Phone-based users with role, device ID, no-show count, and ban flag

**Config:** `drizzle.config.ts` points to `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

**Current state:** The schema is defined for PostgreSQL but the active storage layer is still `MemStorage`. The database is provisioned but the storage class needs to be migrated to use Drizzle queries against PostgreSQL.

**Migrations:** Stored in `./migrations/` directory, managed via `drizzle-kit push`

### Authentication Flow

1. User selects role (Player / Owner / Guest) on `/select-role`
2. For Player/Owner: enters phone number → server generates OTP (logged in console in dev)
3. User enters 6-digit OTP → server verifies → issues JWT
4. JWT stored in AsyncStorage; app reads it on launch to auto-authenticate
5. Guest mode stores a guest flag in AsyncStorage; prompts login on protected actions

### API Communication

- `lib/query-client.ts` – Centralizes API base URL resolution using `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` env variable
- `apiRequest()` utility wraps fetch with JSON headers, base URL construction, and error throwing
- `getQueryFn()` factory creates TanStack Query-compatible fetch functions with 401 handling

### Mock Data

Venues and time slots are currently mocked in `context/BookingsContext.tsx` (as `MOCK_VENUES` and `TIME_SLOTS`). These are used throughout the app until a real venues API is connected.
